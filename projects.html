                    <p>In this this website I styled a banking dashboard using SASS. I  used main feaurures of it that include modules, mixins as well as extend/inheritance. It is not functioning as I was just getting a feel for using the framework.</p>

                    <p>Heres a webpage I built using bootstrap. I made it so it will be useable on a phone as well. When the screen shrinks to a phones size the nav bar at the bottom stacks to make it better on mobile.</p>

                    <p>This app is a golf scorecard that uses an api in order to get data from the three courses that I used. Then once a course is selected all that courses information is displayed in the boxes. Theres a textbox that allows a user to enter a name and every score the user enters is automatically added up and put in the totals box.</p>
